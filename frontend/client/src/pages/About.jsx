                        Hey, I'm Makomborero “Mako” Chiripanyanga, a multidisciplinary creative based in Johannesburg, South Africa.
                        I work across photography, colour grading, video editing, cinematography, and directing — bringing stories to
                        life through visuals that resonate. My work captures raw emotion, authentic energy, and bold style, merging
                        creative vision with technical precision. From collaborating with underground artists to established brands,
                        I strive to create visuals that feel alive and true. I’ve worked with artists such as KindlyNxsh, Blxckie,
                        Blaqbonez, Pabi Cooper, Brotherkupa, Jaykatana, Shouldbeyuang, and Shekhinah, as well as brands like Cold Soul,
                        Cobalt, FYM3021, and Blest Club. My philosophy is simple: I aim to tell stories that move people — to turn
                        dreams into reality, one shot at a time.
